This is my implementation of the 2048 game. It is an exercise to develop clean object-oriented code. 
The program includes the following files:
- TwoThousandFortyEight.java coordinates these different objects and calls the
    right methods on it depending on the input from the user so as to actually
    simulate a 2048 game
- The Tile class implements the Tile object, that represents individual Tiles
- The Board class implements the Board object, that simulates the
    group of Tiles when considered together, and how they interact
- TileInterface.java describes the API for the Tile class 
- BoardInterface.java describes the API for the Board class 
- PennDraw is the graphical library used to make the game look nice It was developed by Upenn.

Compile all files listed above. Then, run TwoThousandFortyEight.java. 
    Then, play 2048 normally:
    - Use a, s, d, w to move 
    - Click on replay with the mouse to replay
